# MeasurementModelDemos

This repo illustrates solutions of wave-like measurement models,
which are basically errors-in-variables linear regression models
that include an extra model term for nonlinear association, and
whose solution employ longitudinal (nearly collocated) samples.
These samples fall within the autocorrelation envelope, which is
where the notion of a "wave-like" model comes from.
